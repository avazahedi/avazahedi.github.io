## Software Projects at International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF)
<br>
Remote position working for IFF during summer 2020.

#### Weather and News API
The first project I worked on was developing APIs for displaying weather and news. For the weather API, I used OpenWeather. I incorporated the ability to show an hourly forecast and a 5-day forecast, and gave the user the option to input any location of their choice. For the news API, I used web scraping from IFF's website to retrieve the current news around the company. Similarly, I incorporated the ability for the user to specify the dates of interest as well as offer keyword searches.  
Through this project I learned several new skills, such as HTML formatting, web scraping, and working with APIs. The majority of this project was done using Python.

#### Smart Glasses App
Another project the innovations team worked on at IFF was developing an app for smart glasses. The app is designed to be worn by the user while producing a compound. The app goes step-by-step with the user during production and provides a checklist, ensuring that the compound is made correctly. We designed it such that the app would access the ingredients list from a database, display it on the screen, and allow the user to begin production. We integrated the built-in capabilities of the glasses with custom commands to fit our needs. Additionally, I specifically worked on incorporating speech recognition and functionality for a totally hands-free process when wearing the glasses. This was all done in Java using Android Studio.
