## Big Data & Visualization

During my summer 2019 internship at RightHand Robotics, my primary project was to find a way to take raw data from active robots and convert them to understandable, usable information for both the company and for customers. The image below illustrates each step of how I achieved my mission. Each block represents a query I wrote to organize the data for a given project. Throughout this project, I used Google BigQuery, in which I programmed in SQL. Ultimately, the organized data was inserted into Klipfolio for visualization.
