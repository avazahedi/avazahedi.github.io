Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

I am a graduate student at Northwestern University pursuing my MS in Robotics from September 2022 to December 2023.  
I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering.  
My interests include industrial robotics, medical robotics, and artificial intelligence.
