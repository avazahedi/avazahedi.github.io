# **About Me**

<br>
Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:
<br>

<br>
<center><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/profile.jpg" width=420/></center>
<br>

I am a graduate student at Northwestern University pursuing my MS in Robotics as part of the 2022-23 cohort.  
I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering.  
My interests include medical robotics, industrial robotics, and artificial intelligence.

<br>
Given the flexibility of my program, I am currently open to either summer 2023 internship positions for a December 2023 graduation or full time positions for a September 2023 graduation. Please feel free to reach out regarding opportunities--or just to talk about robotics!--via one of the media at the bottom of the page.
