# **About Me**

<br>
Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:
<br>

<br>
<center><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/profile.JPEG" width=380/></center>
<br>

I graduated from Northwestern University with a MS in Robotics as part of the 2022-23 cohort.  
In 2022, I graduated from the University of Connecticut with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering.  
I'm excited about tackling complex robotics problems and using robotics in a range of applications 
to help improve safety and quality of life on all scales.

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and saxophone.
