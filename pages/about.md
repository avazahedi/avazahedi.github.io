# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

<br>

I am a graduate student at Northwestern University pursuing my MS in Robotics as part of the 2022-23 cohort.  
I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering.  
My interests include medical robotics, industrial robotics, and artificial intelligence.  

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and saxophone.
